            <p>
                Originally, the idea started as 2 sets of rings. One set was slightly larger than the other so that
                they could stack if the sets were alternated. The toy was fun, but we wanted to find a way
                to create stacking rings that didn't need 2 sets. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One day, while playing with the prototype, we realized that if the rings had a different geometry, they would
                stack when rotated. After that realization, it didn't take very much 3D design to create the Fibinacci rings. As
                we desinged the rings, we didn't have super specific measurements in mind besides making sure that the rings
                wouldn't be so thing they broke and that the most inner shape wouldn't be a choking hazard. That's why
                we were so surpised when we cut the pattern and something looked familiar. We finally did some measurements and
                realized that we had accidentlly created a pattern that followed the Fibinacci Sequence.

            </div>
            <p>
                The shape was mesmerized and was so fun to play with. We experimented with how to router the sides and more
                efficient ways to cut the wood with the CNC, but we didn't any of the essential details about the shape
            </p>
            <p>
                The final change we made to this toy was actually suggested to us from an online toy-making group:color.
                The original design for the toy was only with natural wood, but we had so many requests for color that we decided
                to try it out. We were IN LOVE with the result, and even though it was a pain to manufacture, we still love it.

            </div>
            <p>
                We were really surprised how our girls ended up playing with this toy. We knew it would be an interesting puzzle
                to make all of the rings fit together and stack, but our oldest actually uses it for small world play as well.
                She uses it as a volcano, a mountain, and home for all of her animals.
