            <p>(movie of galaxy)The galaxy was one of our first toys, and also our favorite. At first, it seemed like such a simple idea:
                 create a wooden version of the Spiral Wishing Wells that you might find
                at a children's museum. The motion of the coin is so entrancing for kids and we wanted to replicate it. 
                We also loved how the motion mimicked objects orbitting in space. However, this toy was tough to develop. 
                (pic of Wishing Well toy)
            </p>
            <div><img src="../media/new-wishing-well.jpeg"/></div>
            <p>One of our first problems was designing how steep to make the incline.
                If we made it too steep, then the ball wouldn't rotate for very long. If 
                we made the incline too shallow, then the ball would lose mementium. (
                    insert part here from Rhett about how he picked the slope). Eventually,
                    we found the perfect slope and the kids absolutely loved it.

                <div><img src="../media/galaxy-prod.jpg"/></div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Our next step was to find out how to make the the ball run stand up. We 
                thought about making a solid shape base, like a cylinder, but that didn't 
                seem stable enought. We finally settled on three columns that were threaded
                so that they could be removed for shipping. It was always a huge hurdle
                to design toys that looked good, were fun to play with, and could
                easily ship. (pic of upside downn of ball run)

            </div>
            <p>This toy has been our biggest seller, and is still our
                most requested toy. We love the open endedness of the toy combined with
                it's effectiveness as a learning manipulative.  
                As an added bonus, we found that marbles, spinning tops, and other toys 
                work really well and are fun to watch orbit. (pic or movie of ball run 
                marbles and spinning top)

                Since the Galaxy Ball Run was such a big seller, we decided to try a few more
                simple ball runs. We made a (insert Rhett's part) and an elliptical ball run.
                Both turned out really well, and we love their simplicity.
